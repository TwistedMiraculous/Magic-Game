# Magic Game

## Overview  
**Magic Game** was crafted as part of Hack Club's *High Seas Event*. It’s supposed to be a 2D fantasy adventure where you take on the role of a spellcaster. While the game is still in its early stages, it offers a glimpse of what’s to come—dynamic combat mechanics, magical abilities, and an engaging challenge! Expect some bugs as I continue to enhance it.

## Features  
- **Player Combat Mechanics**: Attack the enemy using three magical powers, activated by pressing **A**, **S**, and **W**.  
- **Health Bars**: The enemy has dynamic health bars that reflect damage taken.  
- **Enemy Counterattacks (Coming Soon)**: The enemy fights back, ensuring a tense and exciting battle.  
- **Game Over Screen (Coming Soon)**: When your health drops to zero, the game transitions to a "Start Over" screen.  


## How to Play  
1. Clone or download the project repository.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.  
3. Use the keyboard controls (A, S, W) to cast magical attacks and the arrow keys to move the players around.  
4. Survive as long as possible by managing your health and defeating the enemy (Well for now you don't take damage).  
5. If your health drops to zero, restart the game to try again ( Not in the game yet)!

## Development Story  
I had tried using the Canvas API for the very first time, It was very annoying to use at first but I think I am getting the hang of it!

### Tools & Technologies:  
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Formed the foundation of the game.  
- **Canvas API**: Used for rendering characters, health bars, and animations.  
- **Custom Code**: All mechanics, from health systems to game states, were built from scratch.  

## Future Plans  
I will implement the following in to the game:  
- **Game Assets** will be implemented at the end once I have added in the damage delt by enemies to the player.  
- **Power-ups** and additional magical spells.  
- **Levels** with increasing difficulty and unique challenges will be added in a far future.  
- **Customization** for characters to let players personalize their experience.

I hope you enjoy **Magic Game** and welcome your feedback to help shape its future!
