Magic Game

What is "Magic Game"?

"Magic Game" is an enchanting 2D fantasy experience where you step into the role of a daring adventurer battling an ever-encroaching enemy. With vibrant sprite animations, a dynamic health bar, and engaging gameplay mechanics, this project was built to bring a sense of whimsy and challenge to players who enjoy fast-paced, strategic combat games.

Why We Built It

The idea behind "Magic Game" was to explore the magic of creativity, coding, and storytelling while delivering an engaging gaming experience. It’s a love letter to nostalgic 2D games we grew up playing and a way to showcase how programming and art can merge to create something truly magical.

The game’s story emerged from countless moments spent daydreaming about pixel-perfect battles, spell-slinging action, and compelling mechanics that keep players coming back for more. It’s also a project aimed at honing programming and game development skills while having a ton of fun in the process.

How We Built It

"Magic Game" was brought to life using the following tools and technologies:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The foundational tech stack used to create the game.

Canvas API: For rendering the player and enemy animations, and handling all the visual aspects of the game world.

Sprite Sheets and GIF Animations: Used for smooth character movements and idle animations.

Custom Logic: Player and enemy mechanics, health systems, damage handling, and game states were coded manually for a unique touch.

Features

Player and Enemy Health Bars: Visual indicators that dynamically update during gameplay.

Player Combat Mechanics: Players can attack enemies, dealing damage and progressing the game.

Enemy Counterattacks: The enemy strikes back, keeping players on their toes.

Game Over Screen: If the player’s health reaches zero, the game gracefully transitions to a "Start Over" screen.

Beautiful Title Screen: AI-generated title art sets the magical tone from the start.
